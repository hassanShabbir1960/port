As a Machine Learning Engineer at Voicemaker, my role involved training Text-to-Speech (TTS) models on several voices to be used on the platform for generating audio files for various applications such as audiobooks, podcasts, e-learning materials, and YouTube videos. The models were designed to create natural-sounding speech by incorporating different intonations, pauses, and accents.
