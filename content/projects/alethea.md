CharacterGPT is the world's first Multimodal AI System that generates interactive AI Characters from a natural language description. As an employee, I built speech synthesis Text-to-Speech engines for the company's CharacterGPT platform, enabling the creation of immersive and interactive characters that respond to users' inputs.
